What is the future of reading physical books? 

Does anyone want to sit down and read or is a audiobook with ml generated images in a video running in the background the way forward? 

My newest project will explore using some paid and diy api Text-to-Image machine learning models to create visual audiobooks from book text.

## Why?

* Opening access to more books by providing it in a video format with images in the context of the book. 
* Creating videos for those who enjoy both a visual and audiotory sense of a book instead of the text on paper. 
* Those who find it hard to finish some text and would like to have it read like an audiobook, but still understand the context from the visual.

After initial development to get a working API, we then look to create a deep machine learning model to generate better visuals for the visual audiobooks. Getting closer to what the text is expressing and a visual context will be our highest hurdle.
